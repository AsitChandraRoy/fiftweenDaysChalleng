    <title>HTML All Important Questions To Crack The Interviews</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- -**Step 1**: **Basic HTML Questions** -->
<!-- 1. **What is HTML?** Explain its purpose & Basic Syntax Of HTML ? -->
<!-- HTML:
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages and web applications. It acts as the backbone of a webpage. -->

<!-- Purpose of HTML:
Structure Web Pages: HTML provides a structure that browsers can interpret and display for users.
Link web pages: "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
Present Media: HTML helps present multimedia like images, audio, video, and interactive elements.
Enhance Accessibility: By using semantic HTML tags such as nav, header, article, aside, footer, section etc HTML makes content more accessible to anyone -->

<!-- Basic Syntax of HTML:
HTML documents are composed of elements enclosed within tags. Tags are placed inside angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash (/) before the tag name. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Declares the document type as HTML5, so the browser understands the HTML version being used. It is not case sensitive -->
<html>
    <!-- The root element of the HTML document. -->
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
   <!-- Contains meta-information about the document, like its title, character encoding, and linked resources (CSS, JavaScript) -->
  <body>
    <!-- Contains all the visible content of the webpage -->
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <!-- A heading element. HTML provides multiple heading levels (<h1> to <h6>) -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!-- Represents a paragraph of text -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
    <!-- An anchor tag used to create hyperlinks to other pages or resources. -->
  </body>
  <!-- closing of body tag -->
</html>
<!-- The root element closed -->


<!-- 2. **What are HTML tags?** How are they structured? Give Us 5 Tags As A Example. -->
<!-- HTML tags:
HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks in HTML that define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags consist of keywords enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag tells the browser where to start a specific section of content, and the closing tag tells it where to end. -->

<!-- Structure of HTML tags:
HTML tags are typically structured like this:
<tagname>
    opening tag
    Content(The information that will appear on the webpage)
</tagname>
closing tag using (/) before the tagname -->


<!-- What are HTML tags?
HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks in HTML that define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags consist of keywords enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag tells the browser where to start a specific section of content, and the closing tag tells it where to end. -->

<!-- Structure of HTML tags:
HTML tags are typically structured like this: -->
<!-- code in HTML -->
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
<!-- Opening tag: <tagname>
Content: The information that will appear on the webpage.
Closing tag: </tagname> (Notice the / before the tag name). -->

<!-- Examples of HTML tags:
Here are five commonly used HTML tags:
(a) <h1>This is a top label heading tag</h1>

(b) <p>This is a paragraph of text</p>

(c) <a href="URL">This is a hyperlink to another webpage.</a>

(d) <img src="URL" alt="Description">
Embeds an image in the page

(d)
This is an unordered list
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item</li>
    </ul> -->


<!-- 3. What is the difference between `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<html>` tags? & the role of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration? -->
<!-- The difference between `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<html>` tags is `<head>` includes metadata, title `<body>` contains all visible content on the web page, `<html>` is the container of `<head>` and `<body>` tags. -->

 <!-- & <!DOCTYPE html> sets the document type is HTML 5. -->

<!-- 4. Describe the function of the `<title>` tag. Where does it appear With Example. -->
<!-- The function of the `<title>` Tag:
Display in Browser Tabs: The content within <title> is shown as the tab name in the browser, helping users quickly identify open pages.
Bookmark Identification: When users bookmark a page, the title is used as the default name for that bookmark.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines use the title as a primary indicator of page content, making it crucial for ranking in search results.
Accessibility: Screen readers use the title to announce the page's purpose when navigating. -->

<!-- Example: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Introduction to HTML Basics</title>
  placing the title
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to HTML Basics</h1>
  <p>This page introduces the basic concepts of HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
<!-- In this example, “Introduction to HTML Basics” would be displayed as the title in the browser tab. -->

<!-- 5. How do you add comments in HTML, and why are they useful? -->

<!-- In HTML, comments are added using the syntax -->
<!-- comment text here -->.
  <!-- Anything placed within these tags is ignored by the browser, so it does not appear on the webpage. -->

<!-- Why HTML Comments Are Useful:
Code Explanation: Comments help describe sections of code anyone can understand the purpose or functionality of specific parts.
Debugging Aid: They allow coder to temporarily disable code to test issues without deleting it entirely.
Organization: Comments can be used as headers or dividers to organize sections in larger files, improving readability. -->

<!-- - **Step 2: HTML Elements and Attributes** -->
<!-- 6. What is the difference between an HTML element and an HTML attribute give us example with proper Explanation. -->
<!-- Definition: HTML element is the core HTML structure or content, while HTML attribute add specific characteristics or behaviors to that structure or content. -->

<!-- Placement: HTML element has an opening and usually a closing tag, on the other hand, HTML attribute placed inside the opening tag of an element. -->

<!-- Example: HTML element: <p>Content</p>,
         HTML attribute: <input type="text" title="content" placeholder="enter your email" >, here type, title, placeholder are attributes. -->

<!-- 7. Explain the global attributes in HTML, such as `class`, `id`, `style`, and `title` With Example. -->

<!-- Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be used with almost any HTML element. -->

<!-- class Attribute:
The class attribute is used to assign one or more classes to an HTML element, making it easy to style or manipulate multiple elements with the same class. -->

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p class="intro-text">This is a paragraph.</p>
<p class="intro-text">This is another paragraph with the same class.</p>
In this example:
Both <p> elements are given the class="intro-text".

Using CSS, we could apply styles to all elements with this class:
<!-- code in CSS -->
.intro-text {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #333;

}

id Attribute:
The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an HTML element. This is particularly useful for styling specific elements. Each id value should be unique within the HTML document.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<h1 id="main-heading">Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p id="intro">This paragraph introduces the website.</p>

In this example:
The <h1> element has an id="main-heading", and the <p> element has an id="intro".

IDs can be used to apply unique CSS styles or link directly to elements:
css
<!-- code in CSS -->
#main-heading {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
}

style Attribute:
The style attribute allows us to apply inline CSS directly to an HTML element. It is used to add specific styles to an individual element without affecting others.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p style="color: green; font-size: 18px;">This paragraph is styled with inline CSS.</p>
In this example:
The paragraph will appear in green text with a font size of 18px.
Inline styles using the style attribute are often less preferred for maintainability compared to external CSS.

title Attribute:
The title attribute provides additional information about an element, usually displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<button title="Click to submit your response">Submit</button>

In this example:
When a user hovers over the "Submit" button, they will see a tooltip displaying "Click to submit your response."

<!-- 8. What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in an `<img>` tag? -->

The `alt` attribute in an `<img>` tag provides alternative text for an image. there are two main purposes:

Accessibility for Screen Reader: The alt text allows screen reader to describe the image for visually any user. This helps make web content more accessible.

Fallback Text When Image Fails to Load: If the image cannot be displayed due to a loading issue or a broken link, the alt text will appear in its place, giving users context about what the image represents.

Example
<!-- code in HTML -->
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">

In this example:
If the image logo.png loads successfully, it will display as usual.
If the image fails to load or is accessed by a screen reader, users will see or hear "Company Logo."

<!-- 9. Describe the `href` attribute and its role in the `<a>` tag? -->

The href attribute in an <a> (anchor) tag specifies the URL or location that the link will navigate to when clicked. It plays a central role in hyperlinking, allowing users to move between pages on a website, jump to specific sections, or open external resources.

Structure:
The basic structure of a link with the href attribute looks like this:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
In this example:
The href attribute points to "https://www.example.com", so clicking the link text "Visit Example" will take the user to that URL.

`href` attribute's role in the `<a>` tag? :
External Links: Linking to an external site or resource.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

Internal Links: Linking to other pages within the same website.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="/about.html">About Us</a>

Page Sections (using id): Jumping to specific sections within the same page.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="#contact">Contact Us</a>
<!-- Later in the document -->
<h2 id="contact">Contact Information</h2>

Email Links: Starting an email with a preset email address.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="info@gmail.com">Email Us</a>

Telephone Links: Initiating a phone call on supported devices.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>

<!-- 10. How does the `target` attribute work within an `<a>` tag? What is `_blank`? -->

The target attribute in an <a> tag specifies where to open the linked document. It determines whether the link will open in the current tab, a new tab, or a specific iframe, based on the attribute's value.

Common Values of target
_blank: Opens the linked document in a new tab or window.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Open in New Tab</a>
_blank is often used for external links or resources to keep users on the main site.

_self: (default) Opens the linked document in the same tab or window.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_self">Open in Same Tab</a>
If target is omitted, it behaves as if _self is specified, opening in the same tab.

_parent: Opens the link in the parent frame of the current iframe.
Used primarily in iframe or frameset contexts.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_parent">Open in Parent Frame</a>

_top: Opens the linked document in the full, top-level window, breaking out of any nested frames.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="_top">Open in Top Frame</a>

Custom Name: Allows for specifying a named browsing context, like an iframe or a window with a specific name.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<a href="https://example.com" target="myFrame">Open in Specific Frame</a>
If an iframe has name="myFrame", this link opens within that iframe.

<!-- - **Step 3: Common HTML Tags** -->
<!-- 11. How to add favicon in HTML & Why ? -->
How to Add a Favicon in HTML:
To add a favicon,we have to use the <link> tag inside the <head> section of our HTML document.

Steps:
Save the Icon File (typically favicon.ico or any standard image format like .png, .jpg, or .svg).
Add the Link Tag in the <head> section.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<head>
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>

Explanation of Attributes:
rel="icon" tells the browser this is a favicon.
href="favicon.ico" specifies the path to the icon file.
type="image/x-icon" or other formats (e.g., image/png for .png) specify the MIME type.

Why Add a Favicon:
Branding: Makes a site easily recognizable.
Usability: Helps users identify and navigate back to our tab.
Professional Appearance: Gives a more polished look to the website.

<!-- 12. What is formatting in HTML? -->

Formatting in HTML refers to using HTML tags to define the appearance or presentation of text and other content on a webpage. It enhance readability and structure in the content displayed on the webpage.

Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

Example:
<del> and <ins>:
<del> shows deleted text, usually with a strikethrough.
<ins> displays inserted text, often underlined.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p>This was <del>deleted text</del> and this is <ins>inserted text</ins>.</p>


<!-- 13. What Is Inline and block elements in html5 Give Us The Proper Explain With Example? -->
Block Elements:
Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, spanning from left to right within their container. They create a "block" of content and generally contain other block or inline elements inside them.

Common Characteristics of Block Elements:
Occupy the entire width of the container by default.
Start on a new line.
Can contain other block or inline elements.

Example of Block Elements:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<div>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph within a block element. It starts on a new line and takes up full width.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a list of unordered list</li>
    </ul>
</div>
above this example, div, h1, p, li in ul are block elements.

Inline Elements:
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as their content requires. They flow within the text and do not break the line structure of surrounding content.

Common Characteristics of Inline Elements:
Only occupy as much width as needed by the content.
Do not start on a new line; they appear "inline" with surrounding elements.
Typically contain only text or other inline elements.

Examples of Inline Elements:
<span>: Used to style parts of text within a larger element.
<a>: Creates hyperlinks.
<img>: Embeds images within content.
<em>, <strong>, <b>, <i>: Used for formatting text.

Example of Inline Elements:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p>This is a paragraph with an <a href="#">inline link</a> and an <span style="color: red;">inline span</span> element.</p>

And  <img>, <em>, <strong>, <b>, <i> are also example of inline elements.
<!-- 14. What is a marquee? -->

In HTML, a marquee is an effect that causes text or images to scroll or move across the screen, usually horizontally. The <marquee> tag was used in older HTML versions to create this scrolling effect, but it is now obsolete and generally avoided in modern web development.

Characteristics of the <marquee> Element:
Text or images within <marquee> move horizontally (left to right or right to left) or vertically (top to bottom or bottom to top).
The scrolling speed, direction, and behavior can be controlled using attributes.

Example of <marquee>:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">This is scrolling text!</marquee>
<marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" loop="2">This is vertical scrolling text!</marquee>

In this example:
The first <marquee> scrolls the text horizontally from left to right.
The second <marquee> scrolls the text vertically and bounces back and forth twice.

<!-- 15. Explain the difference between `<p>`, `<span>`, and `<div>` tags. When would you use each? -->
<p> Tag:
<p> tag is a block-level element. it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<span> Tag:
<span> tag is an inline element. So it does not start on a new line or take up the full width.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<p>This is a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> word within a paragraph.</p>

<div> Tag:
<div> tag is a block-level element, so it starts on a new line and can contain other block and inline elements.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph within a section.</p>
</div>

When to Use Each Tag:
I use <p> tag for paragraphs and large blocks of text.

I use <span> tag when I need to apply specific styles or scripts to a smaller piece of text within a larger text element, without breaking the text flow.

I use <div> tag to create layout containers, organize sections, or wrap multiple elements for styling and structuring purposes.

<!-- 16. Describe the `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags for creating lists. -->

In HTML, the <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags are used to create lists:
<ul> Tag:
Purpose: Creates an unordered (bulleted) list.
Characteristics: The <ul> tag groups list items together without a specific order.
Usage: Ideal for lists where the order of items doesn’t matter, like menus, features, or items in no particular sequence.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Mangos</li>
</ul>

<ol> Tag:
Purpose: Creates an ordered (numbered) list.
Characteristics: The <ol> tag organizes items in a specific sequence or order, usually numbered or lettered.
Usage: Useful for steps, instructions, rankings, or lists where the order is important.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<ol>
    <li>Prepare ingredients</li>
    <li>Mix ingredients</li>
    <li>Then boil for 30 minutes</li>
</ol>

<li> Tag:
Purpose: Defines an individual item within either an unordered (<ul>) or ordered (<ol>) list.
Characteristics: Each <li> element represents a single list item and must be nested within <ul> or <ol>.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ul>
In both <ul> and <ol> lists, the <li> tags contain the content for each list item. These tags help structure content into organized lists, making it easier to read and navigate.


<!-- 17. Describe how `<input>` works and some of its types, such as `text`, `radio`, and `checkbox`. -->

The <input> tag in HTML is used to create interactive controls in a web form that users can use to enter data. It allows users to submit information to a server when they fill out a form. The type of input control is defined using the type attribute of the <input> element.

Structure of the <input> Tag:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<input type="type_name" name="input_name" value="default_value" />
type: Specifies the type of input control.
name: Identifies the input element when the form is submitted.
value: Sets the initial value of the input.

Common Input Types:

Text Input (type="text"):
Purpose: Allows users to enter a single line of text.
Usage: Commonly used for names, email addresses, and other short text entries.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" />

Radio Button (type="radio"):
Purpose: Allows users to select one option from a set of predefined options.
Usage: Often used in cases where only one choice is allowed, such as gender selection or payment method.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" /> Male</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" value="female" /> Female</label>

Checkbox (type="checkbox"):
Purpose: Allows users to select one or more options from a set of predefined options.
Usage: Commonly used for options where multiple selections are allowed, such as subscription preferences or feature selections.
Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label><input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" value="newsletter" /> Subscribe to newsletter</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="terms" value="agree" /> Agree to terms and conditions</label>

<!-- 18. What are `<button>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` tags, and how do they function? -->
<button> Tag:
The <button> tag is used to create a clickable button that can perform an action when clicked. It can contain text, images, or both, and can be styled with CSS.

Attributes in <button> tag:
type: Defines the button's behavior. Common values are:
button: A generic button that does not submit a form.
submit: Submits the form data to a server.
reset: Resets the form data to its initial values.
onclick: JavaScript event that defines what happens when the button is clicked.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>

<textarea> Tag:
The <textarea> tag is used to create a multi-line text input field where users can enter larger amounts of text, such as comments or messages.

Attributes in <textarea> Tag:
rows: Specifies the visible number of lines in the text area.
cols: Specifies the visible width of the text area.
placeholder: Provides a short hint that describes the expected value of the text area.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label for="comments">Comments:</label>
<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Enter your comments here..."></textarea>

<select> Tag:
The <select> tag creates a drop-down list that allows users to choose one or more options from a list. The options are defined using <option> tags nested within the <select> tag.

Attributes in <select> Tag:
multiple: Allows users to select multiple options (when included).
size: Specifies the number of visible options in the list.

Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label for="fruits">Choose your favorite fruit:</label>
<select id="fruits" name="fruits">
    <option value="apple">Apple</option>
    <option value="banana">Banana</option>
    <option value="orange">Orange</option>
</select>
Multi-select Example:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<label for="colors">Select your favorite colors:</label>
<select id="colors" name="colors" multiple>
    <option value="red">Red</option>
    <option value="green">Green</option>
    <option value="blue">Blue</option>
</select>

<!-- 19. How to link CSS to HTML? -->
Link the CSS File in HTML: Use the <link> tag inside the <head> section of HTML document to link the CSS file.
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>External CSS Example</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- 20. What is the `<label>` tag, and how is it associated with form inputs? -->
The <label> tag in HTML is used to define a label for a form element. It provides a user-friendly way to identify form controls, improving accessibility and usability. The <label> tag can be associated with form inputs like <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements.

Purpose of the <label> Tag:
Accessibility: The <label> tag enhances accessibility by providing a clear description of the associated form element.

User Experience: When a user clicks on the label, it automatically focuses on the associated input field. This is particularly helpful on touch devices, as it increases the clickable area and improves the overall user experience.

Associating a <label> with Form Inputs:
We can associate a <label> with a form input in two ways:

Using the 'for' attribute: The for attribute of the <label> tag should match the id of the corresponding input element. This explicitly associates the label with the input.
    Example:
    Using the for Attribute:
<!-- code in HTML -->
    <form>
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
    </form>
    In this example, clicking on "Username:" will focus on the input field for the username.

Nesting the input inside the label: You can place the input element directly inside the <label> tag, creating an implicit association.
    Example:
    Nesting the Input Inside the Label:
    <!-- code in HTML -->
    <form>
        <label>
            Password:
            <input type="password" name="password">
        </label>
    </form>
Here, the password input is nested inside the label. Clicking on "Password:" will also focus on the password input.

<!-- - **Step 4: Advanced HTML Concepts** -->
<!-- 21. What is the `<iframe>` tag, and what are some common attributes used with it? -->
The <iframe> tag in HTML is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. It allows us to display content from another webpage or even another part of the same webpage inside a rectangular frame. This is commonly used for embedding videos, maps, advertisements, and other external content.

Common Attributes of <iframe>:
src: This attribute specifies the URL of the document to embed. It is the most important attribute and must be provided.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>

width: This attribute defines the width of the iframe. It can be specified in pixels (px) or as a percentage (%).
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600"></iframe>

height: This attribute sets the height of the iframe, also specified in pixels or percentage.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" height="400"></iframe>

frameborder: This attribute was used in earlier HTML versions to define whether the frame should have a border. It can take values of 0 (no border) or 1 (with border). Note that this attribute is deprecated in HTML5; instead, you can use CSS to style borders.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" frameborder="0"></iframe>

allowfullscreen: This boolean attribute enables the iframe to be viewed in full-screen mode if the embedded content supports it.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example" allowfullscreen></iframe>

sandbox: This attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe, such as preventing scripts from running or restricting form submission. You can specify various flags to customize the sandbox behavior.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" sandbox></iframe>

title: This attribute is used to provide a title for the iframe, which helps with accessibility, particularly for screen readers.
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Description of the content"></iframe>

Example of a complete <iframe>:
Here’s a complete example that demonstrates the use of the <iframe> tag:
<!-- code in HTML -->
<iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    width="560"
    height="315"
    allowfullscreen
    title="Embedded YouTube Video"
    sandbox>
</iframe>

<!-- 22. Describe how the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags work, including common attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, and `loop`. -->

The <audio> and <video> tags in HTML5 are used to embed sound and video content, respectively, directly into a web page without the need for third-party plugins. These tags provide a user-friendly interface for audio and video playback.

    <audio> Tag:
    The <audio> tag is used to embed sound files in a web page. It supports various audio formats such as MP3, WAV, and OGG.

        Common Attributes for <audio> tag:
        src: Specifies the URL of the audio file to be played.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3"></audio>

        controls: Adds audio controls like play, pause, and volume to the audio player.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls></audio>

        autoplay: This attribute makes the audio start playing automatically when the page is loaded. (Note: Many browsers have restrictions on autoplay to prevent unsolicited sound.)
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls autoplay></audio>

        loop: Causes the audio to loop continuously after it ends.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls loop></audio>

        muted: Mutes the audio playback. This can be useful for autoplay scenarios.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls autoplay muted></audio>

        preload: Specifies how the audio file should be loaded when the page loads. It can take values like none, metadata, or auto.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls preload="auto"></audio>

        Example of complete <audio> tag:
        <!-- code in HTML -->
        <audio src="song.mp3" controls autoplay loop>
            Your audio is playing
        </audio>

    <video> Tag:
    The <video> tag is used to embed video files in a web page. It supports various video formats such as MP4, WebM, and Ogg.

        Common Attributes for <video> tag:
        src: Specifies the URL of the video file to be played.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4"></video>

        controls: Adds video controls like play, pause, volume, and full-screen options.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls></video>

        autoplay: This attribute makes the video start playing automatically when the page is loaded. (Note: Like audio, many browsers restrict autoplay.)
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls autoplay></video>

        loop: Causes the video to loop continuously after it ends.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls loop></video>

        muted: Mutes the video playback. This is often used with autoplay.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls autoplay muted></video>

        poster: Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading or until the user hits the play button.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls poster="poster-image.jpg"></video>

        preload: Specifies how the video should be loaded when the page loads. It can take values like none, metadata, or auto.
        <!-- code in HTML -->
            <video src="video-file.mp4" controls preload="auto"></video>

        Example of complete <video> tag:
        <!-- code in HTML -->
        <video src="video.mp4" controls autoplay loop poster="thumbnail.jpg">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

<!-- 23. Explain the `<picture>` tag and its usage in responsive design -->
The <picture> tag in HTML is a powerful feature that allows developers to implement responsive images in a more flexible and efficient way. It provides a way to specify multiple source images for different display scenarios, such as varying screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations. This is particularly useful for improving performance and user experience on various devices.

Structure of the <picture> Tag:
<picture>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="image">
</picture>

Usage in Responsive Design:
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="images/large-image.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 400px)" srcset="images/medium-image.jpg">
    <img src="images/small-image.jpg" alt="A scenic view of the mountains">
</picture>
Explanation of the above Example:
For Screens 800px and Up: The browser will load large-image.jpg.
For Screens 400px to 799px: The browser will load medium-image.jpg.
For Screens Below 400px: The browser will load small-image.jpg.

        </div>

        <!-- Submit Button -->
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

</body>
</html>

Explanation of above Form:
Text Input:
This allows the user to enter their name.
The required attribute ensures that the field cannot be left empty.

Radio Buttons:
These allow the user to select one option from the given choices (in this case, gender).
The name attribute is the same for all radio buttons in the group, ensuring only one can be selected at a time.

Checkbox:
This allows the user to opt into a subscription to a newsletter.
The checkbox does not require a selection, meaning the form can be submitted without it.

Submit Button:
This button submits the form data to the server or specified action.

            allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
Explanation of the Code:
HTML Structure:
The <iframe> tag is used to embed the YouTube video. You need to replace the src attribute value with the URL of the YouTube video you want to embed. In this example, it's set to a famous Rick Astley video.
The title attribute is for accessibility, providing a brief description of the embedded content.

CSS for Responsiveness:
The .video-container class is styled to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is common for YouTube videos. This is achieved by using padding-top: 56.25% (calculated as 9/16).

The height is set to 0 to ensure that the container's height is determined by the padding.

The iframe is absolutely positioned to fill the entire container, ensuring that it scales properly with the size of the window.

        <p>Here is some more detailed information that you can toggle. Feel free to add more content here as needed.</p>
    </details>

</body>
</html>
Explanation of the Code:
HTML Structure:
The <details> tag creates a collapsible section. It can contain a <summary> tag and any other HTML content.
The <summary> tag acts as the clickable heading for the collapsible section. When clicked, it toggles the visibility of the content inside the <details> tag.

Content:
Inside the <details>, you can include any HTML content. In this example, I've added a paragraph and a list to demonstrate how you can structure the information within a collapsible section.

        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a simple navigation bar example.</p>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
Explanation of the Code:

HTML Structure:
The <nav> tag is used to define the navigation section of the webpage.
Inside the <nav>, an unordered list (<ul>) is created to hold the navigation links.
Each link is represented by a list item (<li>) containing an anchor tag (<a>) that links to a specific section of the page (or another page).

Links:
The href attribute in the <a> tag points to the respective sections: #home, #about, and #contact. You can replace these with actual URLs if needed.

</html>
Explanation of the Code:

Table Structure:
The <table> element is used to define the table.
A <caption> is included to provide a title for the table, improving accessibility.

Thead:
The <thead> element groups the header content.
The first <tr> contains a header cell for the product name that spans two rows (rowspan="2").
The header cells for Q1 and Q2 sales use colspan="3" to span three columns each, which are further detailed in the next row.

Tbody:
The <tbody> element contains the actual data of the table.
Each <tr> within <tbody> represents a row of data corresponding to different products.
Data cells (<td>) contain values for units sold, revenue, and profit.

Tfoot:
The <tfoot> element contains a summary row with totals.
The first cell uses <th> for the total label, and subsequent <td> cells show the summed values.
